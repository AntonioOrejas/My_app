# My_app

The app I want to develop, consist basically a fishing app. The thing that I mean with this concept, is that I want my program to be used by the people that do fishing as a sport, the practical use of the app is to track all the catches that are done during the fishing day, by this way they could add each fish and add information about it to take into account for future days.


The domains that I have in mind are a couple, the first one would be the day you went fishing and inside of it you will find more domains about each fish. Therefore, inside a day you find all the fishes that you added during the day and each of them have different fields, that are: Name of the fish, weight,
