# My_app

The app I want to develop, consist basically a fishing app. The thing that I mean with this concept, is that I want my program to be used by the people that do fishing as a sport, the practical use of the app is to track all the catches that are done during the fishing day, by this way they could add each fish and add information about it to take into account for future days.


The domains that I have in mind are a couple, the first one would be the day you went fishing and inside of it you will find more domains about each fish. Therefore, inside a day you find all the fishes that you added during the day and each of them have different fields, which are: 
1. Name: You write in that field the name of the species that was caught.
2. Weight: It contains the weight of each fish.
3. Fishing bait: It could be helpful for the user to see clearly how effective is each bait that he uses.
4. Place: Its good to remember where you caught the best fishes or where you found more for future days.
5. Photo: Having a photo of each catch for the user to have a good way of remembering some of the catches he did.


Now speaking about the CRUD operations:
1. Create: You can first create a day, there you can put todays date or another, then that would open a new window where you can create a fish cath where you fill the fields about that fish that you caught that are mentioned in the domain details. However, when you add a fish you can leave some fields empty and fill them later, for example you if cant weigh the fish in that moment.
2. Read: At the moment you open the app, you see a list of all the days that have been created, if you select one of them a window is opened where you see all the fish caught that day, in each of them you see the details of each fish that were added in the past.
3. Update: You can update all the different fields that appeared, for example changing the date, the name of the fish or fill a field that was empty because it was not filled at the moment of the catch.
4. Delete: You can delete two things, a whole day so you get rid of all the information that was added in that day or delete a single fish, so from all the fish of a day only the one that you deleted would dissapear with the information you wrote about it.
